# Ransomware
A simple C program that simulates ransomware in Windows.

## Functionality:
The program encrypts the path "C:\infected" using the Hill Cipher algorithm with a pre-determined key. It then deletes the original files and subfolders, replacing them with new files that have the extension ".enc" added to their names. In addition, the program creates a ransom note in the parent directory, but only if the user executing the program has the necessary write permissions to both the target path and its parent directory.
